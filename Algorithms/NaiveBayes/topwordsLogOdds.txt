The words in this list were completely different as compared to the words in the "stop-words" list.
Also, the words for conservative and loberal were complately different from each other. 

This was expected as the metric (using which we are sorting the list) garuntess that words which are uniquely correlated to the class appear on the top.
They can be though of as "representative" words, which depict the class.
